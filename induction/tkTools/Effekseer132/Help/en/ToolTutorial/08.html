<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>In this chapter, you change the spawn method and arrange the particles at regular intervals. In the spawn method, you can specify the initial pose of the particle. The same thing can be reproduced by using the parent-child relationships of the node, but the same thing can be easily realized.</p>

<h2>Spawn method</h2>
<p>In Effekseer you can specify the spawn method. In the spawn method, you can specify the initial pose when particles are generated. For example, you can arrange particles in a circle or sphere.</p>

<p>You can specify not only the position but also the angle. For example, the upward direction of the particle faces the outside of the sphere.</p>

<h2>Circular effect</h2>
<p>You place the particles in a circle. The particles are displayed in order clockwise.</p>
<p>This effect can be realized by using parent-child relationships, but it is very troublesome. In order to easily realize complicated placement, there is the spawn method.</p>
<p>Please open effect01.efkproj.</p>
<p>The &quot;Spawn method&quot; window is not displayed in the initial setting. You select &quot;Window -&gt; Spawn method&quot; from the menu bar. When you select it, the &quot;Spawn method&quot; window will be displayed.</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="../../img/Tutorial/08_spawn_en.png">
<p>
Spawn method
</p>
</div>
<p>From the &quot;Spawn method&quot; window, specify the circle as the spawn method. Enter 4 for the radius of the circle.</p>
<p>You can see that particles are displayed in a circle.</p>
<div align="center">

<p>
Particles arranged randomly
</p>
</div>
<p>Particles are randomly arranged, so they do not appear in order. Change the <code>Spwan Mode</code> into <code>Clockwise</code> so that it appears in order. In addition to that, change the <code>Verticies</code> and <code>Spawn Count</code> to 12. This indicates that particles are caused to appear at positions equally divided by 12 circles.</p>
<p>You can see that particles are evenly displayed in a circle. At the same time, you can see that the particles appear in turn.</p>

<h2>Spherical effect</h2>
<p>Let's place the particles in a spherical shape.</p>
<p>Please open effect02.efkproj.</p>
<p>Like a circle, you can also set a spherical shape.</p>
<p>You change the spawn method from the ‚ÄùSpawn method&quot; window to sphere. Enter 4 for the radius of the sphere. In addition, to place particles in all directions, enter 360 degrees for the deviation of the <code>X Rotation</code> and the <code>Y Rotation</code>.</p>
<p>You can see that particles are arranged in a spherical shape.</p>

<h3>Affect for angles</h3>
<p>I try to make the particles fly outward in the sphere.</p>
<p>Please open effect03.efjproj.</p>
<p>You can see that particles are flying upwards in the sphere.</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="../../img/Tutorial/08_effect3_start.gif">
<p>
Particles flown upwards
</p>
</div>
<p>However, in fact, when arranging particles in a spherical shape, particles are desired to fly in and out of the sphere. In such cases, check <code>Set angle on spawn</code>. When checked, particles are rotated so that the top of the particle coincides with the outside direction of the sphere when it is generated.</p>
<p>In this case, the particles heading upward will be directed to the outside of the sphere.</p>
<p>When checked, you can see that particles are flying outward from the sphere.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>In this chapter, you changed the spawn method and arranged the particles circularly or linearly. In the next chapter, you will create practical effects based on the knowledge you learned so far.</p>
