		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>
This software is a particle effect editing tool. By incorporating runtime and plug-ins, you can play effects created with Effekseer in your application. It is assumed to be mainly used in games, so that the designer can handle the particle effect editing rather than the programmer.

        <p>
This software is heavily influenced by BlendMagic (currently, <a href="http://www.matchlock.co.jp/products/" target="_top">BISHAMON</a>). If it were not for BlendMagic, this software would have never existed. I would like to express my sincere thanks here.
