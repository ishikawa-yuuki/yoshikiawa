		<h1>Render - Track</h1>
		
		<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
Here we explain the parameters that affect the drawing when "Track" is selected in the Render window.
</p>

<p>
When "Track" is selected, effects are drawn along a continuous track.
</p>

<p>
The track is drawn by connecting a thick line between all the children of a certain particle instead of drawing each particle individually. For example, if particles 1, 2, and 3 are the children of particle 0, a shape is generated with a track drawn between 1, 2, and 3. The track is shaped by "connecting the dots" between each particle. Unlike the ribbon, which is influenced by the rotation and enlargement of the particle, the track is not influenced by them and always faces the camera.
