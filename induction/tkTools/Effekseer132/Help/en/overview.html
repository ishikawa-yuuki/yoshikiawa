<li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=9CFB2D51-5FF4-4491-B0E5-B386F32C0992&displaylang=ja" target="_top">Microsoft .NET Framework 4 (Full)</a></li>

		<h2>Installation/Uninstallation</h2>
		<p>
        The editing tool exists entirely within the "Tool/" directory. We do not modify the registry, or anything else at all. You can start the program directly, or copy it to any directory.<br/>
        To uninstall, just delete each directory.
		</p>
		<p>
		To play effects in your game, you must download separate packages such as the runtime, Unity, or DX libraries. <br/>
		</p>
		<p>
        Alternatively, if you just want to use the effect as an exported image, sprite sheet, or video, refer to the <a href="ToolReference/record.html">Recording</a> reference guide.
		</p>
		
		<h2>License</h2>
		<p>
		The runtime uses the MIT license. The same license is also used for the <a href="https://directxtk.codeplex.com/">DirectX Tool Kit</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
        You may use texture and effect data freely both in Effekseer, and when using images and effects that were exported from Effekseer elsewhere.
		</p>

		<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
		<p>
		We can not assume any responsibility for troubles etc. when using this software and runtime.
