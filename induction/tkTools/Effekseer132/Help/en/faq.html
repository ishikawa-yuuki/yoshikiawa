		<h1>FAQ</h1>
		<h2>General</h2>
		<h3>How do I pronounce Effekseer?</h3>
		<p>
It is "Effec"+"seer".
		</p>

		<h2>Editing Tool</h2>
		<h3>My changes to parameters are not getting applied.</h3>
		<p>
If you change a parameter's value, please press enter afterwards, or move the focus to a different field. The change will be applied by doing so.
		</p>

		<h3>My rotation settings are not applied to the sprite.</h3>
		<p>
If the drawing method is "Sprite", rotation will be ignored when the render configuration is set to "Billboard" (since Billboard locks the sprite's rotation to make it always face the camera). To apply rotation to a sprite render, please choose any of the other render configuration options.
		</p>

		<h3>How do I record?</h3>

When you select "Window -> Recording" from the editing tool, the recording screen will be displayed. By pressing Record on the recording screen, the recording result is output to the directory where "Effekseer.exe" exists. If you select "Window -> Viewpoint Operation", the viewpoint operation screen will be displayed. On the viewpoint operation screen, you can manipulate the viewpoint numerically.
